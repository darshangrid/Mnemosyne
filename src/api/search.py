    "answer": "> **GymLytics: AI-powered Realtime Workout Analytics**\n\nGymLytics is an AI-powered application that provides real-time workout analytics to help users optimize their fitness routines. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze key points associated with the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and ankles during various exercises.\n\n> **Posture Correction:** GymLytics employs a sophisticated approach that combines keypoint detection, analysis, and limb angle assessment to offer a detailed understanding of each exercise. Taking the example of planks, GymLytics meticulously analyzes the key points corresponding to the shoulder, hip, and ankle. By examining the spatial relationships among these crucial points, GymLytics derives precise information about the participant\u2019s body alignment during the exercise.\n\n> **Performance Optimization:** The application significantly boosts the efficiency of keypoint analysis by tailoring the input to include only the relevant skeletal markers for each exercise. This targeted approach enhances the speed of keypoint analysis and ensures that the computational resources are allocated precisely where needed, contributing to a more optimized and responsive performance overall.\n\n> **Key Features:**\n\n*   Key point detection and analysis\n*   Limb angle assessment\n*   Posture correction\n*   Performance optimization\n\n> **References:**\n\n[Mediapipe by Google](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)\n\n> **Image:**\n\n![Motion tracking with MediaPipe](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*PD2VI55HZut6yGXXDyTKCg.gif)\n\n> **Follow-up Questions:*\n\n*   How does GymLytics handle user data privacy?\n\n*   Can GymLytics be integrated with popular fitness tracking devices?\n\n*   What are the future plans for GymLytics in terms of feature development and expansion?\n\n> **Sources:**\n\n[Mediapipe by Google](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)\n\n",
